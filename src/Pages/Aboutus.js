        <p>
          We transform how companies change their relationships with customers.
          We live this every day. This means empathically looking for potentials
          that give us and our customers shared value. This starts with
          curiosity for others and aspiration towards ourselves to change and
          improve. We listen to our customers, read books, attend courses,
          research and iterate in our product. We accept and appreciate
          criticism and improve processes and thus our own behaviour. We never
          stand still, because our counterpart is constantly changing.
        </p>
